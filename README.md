# About
In this project, we will deploy a static website to AWS. First, we will create a S3 bucket and upload the website files to our bucket. Next, we will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies. Next, we will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™ content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, we will access our website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
